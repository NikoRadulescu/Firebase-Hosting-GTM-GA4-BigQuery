# Step by step tutorial

Create a landing page. Add GTM and GA4. Publish the landing page on the internet using Firebase Hosting. 
Enable raw data from GA4 using BigQuery integration. 

**Min requirements / you will need access to:**
- A Google Cloud Platform project / Firebase console;
- Google Tag Manager;
- Google Analytics 4;

### 1. Prepare the landing page ([video 0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNBp3Jw_ZEc&t=0s))

Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/, select your project and Activate Cloud Shell then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/App-Landing-Page.git
cd App-Landing-Page
```

hit "Open Editor" and explore the landing.

### 2. Create Firebase Project ([video 0:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNBp3Jw_ZEc&t=34s))

Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ and hit "Add project", select your GCP Project or create a new one. Enable analytics -> Create a new account or select your GA account. Next and you ready.

### 3. Host the landing page on Firebase Hosting ([video 1:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNBp3Jw_ZEc&t=75s))

Back to GCP Cloud Shell, just run:

```
firebase init 

// auth 
// select "Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting" (with space) and Enter.
// select: use an existing project -> select your project
// What do you want to use as your public directory? public : hit enter
// Configure as a single-page app: hit y
// Set up automatic builds ... : hit N
```

```	
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

If everything goes fine you will receive a Hosting URL (click on that link : https://{gcp_project_id}.web.app

### 4. Setup Google Tag Manager ([video 2:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNBp3Jw_ZEc&t=135s))

Go to: https://tagmanager.google.com and create a new account. Fill the name, country, container name and select web -> hit "Create" and accept GTM Terms of Service Agreement. You will receive a javascript snippet for gtm client side. Copy the code and let's implement it to our landing.

### 5. Implement GTM and redeploy the landing page ([video 2:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNBp3Jw_ZEc&t=162s))

Back on GCP Cloud Shell, hit "Open Editor" and select "index.html":
- You will copy the first snippet of gtm js code, and paste it as high in the <head> of the page as possible;
- You will copy the second snippet of gtm nojs code, and paste it immediatly after the opening <body> tag;

Save and hit "Open Terminal", then redeploy your landing page.

```
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Install Tag Assistant Legacy (by Google) extension for Chrome. Check if GTM it's running on your website (using Chrome -> Settings -> Developer Tools -> Network and reload the page) or using the Tag Assistant Legacy (by Google) extension.


### 6. Enable GTM + GA4 integration ([video 3:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNBp3Jw_ZEc&t=218s))

Go to: https://analytics.google.com/ and select your Analytics Account. Go to "Admin" -> "Data Streams" -> "Add stream" -> "Web" and fill the form (Website url, Stream name and enable "Enhanced measurement"). At the end of the process you will receive the "Measurement ID" (copy this). 

Go to: https://tagmanager.google.com and select your Tag Manager Account. Go to "Tags" -> "New" -> hit "Tag Configuration" and choose "Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration" and fill the form (paste here the Measurement ID from the GA4 setup). Click on "Triggering" and choose "All pages". Give the tag a name and hit the "Save" button. 

Hit "Submit" and Publish the new GTM version.

### 7. Enable GA4 + BigQuery Integration ([video 5:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNBp3Jw_ZEc&t=300s))

Go to: https://analytics.google.com/ and select your Analytics Account. Go to "Admin" -> "BigQuery Linking" -> "Link" -> "Choose a BigQuery project" and "Location" and hit "Next" -> then on "Frequency" choose what you need (pay attention because on "Streaming" you will have extra costs - check out documentation).

After some time (in our case one day) on GCP -> BigQuery we will have consolidate all the raw data from GA4


Enjoy it!
